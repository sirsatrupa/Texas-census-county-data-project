# Texas-census-county-data-project

- Currently in this project I convert texas county census PDF data into pandas data frames 
- next I want to see if there is any information I can garner from examining the census data compared to the covid cases in each county (in the process)
- look at my linkedin article about this ongoing project: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/extracting-data-from-pdfs-pandas-truett-bloxsom
